##Welcome to my blog

Hii welcome to my blog. I do not know what to write. But here i am with my first blog. Okay let me start with my love story. I was in my 10th standard. We were on a school trip. I spoke with my crush for the first time. Her name was Kshithi rai. She was very beautiful and witty. I deliberately chose a seat beside her while travelling. I felt like touchinh her hand. My body was shivering and gently caressed her finger. She smiled. It was the happiest day of my life till then. Then we got down near a lake. She looked into my eyes giving a signal to stay with her. It was cooking well.
