##Welcome to my blog

Hii welcome to my blog. I do not know what to write. But here i am with my first blog. Okay let me start with my love story. I was in my 10th standard. We were on a school trip. I spoke with my crush for the first time. Her name was Kusum jain. She was very beautiful and witty. I deliberately chose a seat beside her while travelling. I felt like touching her hand. My body was shivering and gently caressed her finger. She smiled. It was the happiest day of my life till then. Then we got down near a lake. She looked into my eyes giving a signal to stay with her. It was cooking well.
After the lake visit we again got on the bus. She held my hand and made me sit beside her. She rested her head on my shoulder while was i was catching my breath. My heart started beating faster. Her hair aroma was kicking on my senses and it was the best experience of my life till then.
